      <p>Within the last decade, fashion has become more of a global industry catering to complex and transnational customers of diverse lifestyles, and cultures. Simultaneously the radical change in communication allows users to participate,
        follow and discuss any trends and fashion news easily. In particular, the blogosphere has become a prime arena within which fashion consumers reside online, bringing to question who and what are
        the influencers within these new digital and cultural spaces in the fashion industry. Hence in regard of all this we created our website to focus on the latest trends and new exciting innovations in the industry.

        <h3>Homepage</h3>
        <p>The goal of the home page is to encourage users to explore what the site has
          to offer. It will allow the users to choose between creating their account or
          logging in to an existing one. It is the first thing that makes up the user
          experience. Focus while designing the homepage is on the interface, design,
          colour scheme, ease of use and simplicity.</p>

        <h3 class="web">Login & Registration</h3>
        <p>User registration and login enables a system to personalize itself. The
          registration page is a list of fields that a user will input data into and submit on
          the website. The login page is the page that provides entry to the website. It requires user
          identification and authentication, regularly performed by entering a username
          and password combination to access the secured part of the website.

        <h3>Fashion Blog</h3>
        <p>The goal of the home page is to encourage users to explore what the site has
          to offer. It will allow the users to choose between creating their account or
          logging in to an existing one. It is the first thing that makes up the user

      <h3 class="web">In-House Store</h3>
      <p>Fashion blogs are perceived as a street of fashion, as a source of authenticity and a display of the actual use of
        fashion by the general public.The findings revealed that the respondents sometimes bought clothes and
        accessories which were the same as or similar to those they had previously seen on fashion blogs and this is an important conclusion so we added an in-house store
        through which you can buy the article (if purchasable) directly from the page. The in-house store module is further divided into the following pages:
       </p>
       <ul>
         <li>Product Description</li>
         <li>Shopping Cart</li>
         <li>Buy Now</li>
         <li>Order Confirmation</li>
       </ul>
