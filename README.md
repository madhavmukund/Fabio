<i><b> Fashio </b>
#### An everything fashion website. </i>
<br>

Within the last decade, fashion has become more of a global industry catering to complex and transnational customers of diverse lifestyles, and cultures which makes the recognition and identification with particular customers more complex. Simultaneously the radical change in communication allows users to participate, follow and discuss any trends and fashion news easily for any collection and purchase them online. In particular, the blogosphere has become a prime arena within which fashion consumers reside online, bringing to question who and what are the influencers within these new digital and cultural spaces in the fashion industry. Blogging in general is considered as a new form of online journalism, enjoying great attention of users, based on a personal and interactive approach, versus the standardized treatment through mainstream media. Fashion blogs are perceived as a street of fashion, as a source of authenticity and a display of the actual use of fashion by the general public. Hence in regard of all this we created our website to focus on the latest trends and new exciting innovations in the industry.
 The findings revealed that the respondents sometimes bought clothes and accessories which were the same as or similar to those they had previously seen on fashion blogs and this is an important conclusion so we added an in-house store through which you can buy the article (if purchasable) directly from the page.


### Modules

## Homepage

The goal of the home page is to encourage users to explore what the site has to offer. It will allow the users to choose between creating their account or logging in to an existing one. It is the first thing that makes up the user experience. Focus while designing the homepage is on the interface, design, colour scheme, ease of use and simplicity. These things define if a visitor will stay or leave.

## Registration and Login

User registration and login enables a system to personalize itself. The registration page is a list of fields that a user will input data into and submit on the website. The main use of registration forms is to sign up customers for subscriptions to articles, services, or provide order related information.

The login page is the page that provides entry to the website. It requires user identification and authentication, regularly performed by entering a username and password combination to access the secured part of the website. If the user does not have username/password (account) on the website he should register with the website and create credentials(username/password) for himself.

## Fashion Blog

After logging into the website, the user can access the fashion blog which consist of a variety of articles about the latest fashion trends. The user can search for a specific article or filter the articles according to his choice. The products described in the articles would be sold on the website. If the user wishes to buy the recommended merchandise, he will be directed to the product page for more information about it.
