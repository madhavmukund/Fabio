                    Within the last decade, fashion has become more of a global industry catering to
                    complex and transnational customers of diverse lifestyles, and cultures which makes
                    the recognition and identification with particular customers more complex.
                    Simultaneously the radical change in communication allows users to participate,
                    follow and discuss any trends and fashion news easily for any collection and
                    purchase them online. In particular, the blogosphere has become a prime arena
                    within which fashion consumers reside online, bringing to question who and what are
                    the influencers within these new digital and cultural spaces in the fashion industry.
                    Hence in regard of all this we created our website to focus on the latest trends and 
                    new exciting innovations in the industry.</p>

                        Fashion is most often thought of as a global industry that is invested in anticipating what we wear and how we wish to appear to others. But fashion isn’t just a business. It’s also a cultural and social phenomenon, 
                        driven by the desire for the new. Fashion is about storytelling through clothing; it’s about the stories behind them and the ones you create around them. It’s a cultural influence, backstory or intellectual touchpoint 
                        that you can trace back to what you’re wearing. We use it to escape the mundane, to embrace and celebrate tradition. It’s about a sense of history and pride and it embodies a greater sense of purpose than just a garment 
                        tossed on to cover bodies.
